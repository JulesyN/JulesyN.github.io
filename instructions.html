				<h1>Supplies</h1>
                <p>In order to first start the building process, we need
                    to make sure that the supplies that we get are 
                    compatible with each other. The first thing that
                    comes to mind when starting the building process
                    is the case that will store the parts for the
                    computer. Next step is to find a motherboard. Make 
                    sure to get a motherboard that fits inside the case 
                    you pick, if it is too big for the case or if it barely
                    fits in, then nothing else will be able to fit inside
                    either. Next we'll need a CPU (Centeral Processing 
                    Unit) that will go on the motherboard. Intel i5 or i7s
                    are popular among most computers in today's standards.
                    Then it is best to get a CPU fan, as all CPUs tend to
                    get very hot as the computer is on. The next important
                    item is the power supply. It is important to note how
                    many watts the power supply will give, if there is too
                    little, the computer will not run. The next big part 
                    is the GPU (Graphical Processing Unit). This essentially
                    allows the computer to display things on screen in the 
                    first place. People tend to spend a lot of money on
                    GPUs depending on what they want to do with their 
                    computer so it is advised to set a budget and spend 
                    a fair amount on GPUs, as they also can vastly 
                    improve performance. Next is HDD, or hard drive. 
                    This will store data on your computer, in orther 
                    words, it is how much space your computer has. 
                    1 Terabyte should be more than enought for 
                    anyone, but one could also get an SSD, which
                    essentially makes the transfer of the storage
                    faster, at the expense of being a bit more epxenseive.
                    Finally, there is the RAM. The RAM also manages the 
                    speed of the transfer of data, however it can stack
                    with the SSD and make things even faster. 
                    when one gets efficent and epxerienced with 
                    computers, they will want to move through the 
                    interface as fast as they can. If there are none 
                    equipped, one should also think about getting 
                    fans or a coolant system. Thought a coolant system
                    is more efficent, it is a bit more risky, as if liquid
                    leaks and gets in the wrong parts, the computer can 
                    be ruined. Fans are a lot more safe, but one should 
                    make sure there is space for it inside the computer.
                </p>
                <h1>Assembly Instructions</h1>
                <p>It is generally recommended that one should start by
                    assembling the motherboard first. Insert the 
                    CPU into the square slot near the middle of the 
                    motherboard, as well as plug in the CPU fan ontop 
                    of it. RAM and the SSD can also be installed at 
                    this point. After the motherboard is finished,
                    it can be screwed into the case. Then one can 
                    install the HDD/Hard Drive, since it uaully only
                    requires one cable. Next is the powersupply. 
                    Be careful when dealing with it as there are a 
                    lot of cables involved and it is crucial to match
                    the wires with the right ports or else the computer 
                    will not start. It is also recommended to plug in 
                    the wires that are from the case so that the buttons,
                    ports, and lights. These wires can be organized 
                    within the case for ease of access so that one can
                    switch parts if they wanted to upgrade. Next is the 
                    GPU which is usually installed near the end so that
                    the amount of space can be verifed for the GPU. 
                    Finally, if there isn't any fans on the case, the 
                    coolant system/fans should be installed or moved
                    last. This is so that one can make sure that the 
                    coolant/air circulation can target the hot areas
                    when everything is assembled. Then one can plug 
                    the computer and monitor in and install their 
                    desired operating system with a USB.
